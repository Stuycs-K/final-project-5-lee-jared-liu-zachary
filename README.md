# APCS2 Final Project
THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info
Names: Jared Lee and Zachary Liu  
Group Name: Big 2
## Overview
We created a fully functional Chinese Poker multiplayer game (2-4 players). Chinese Poker or “Big 2” is a card game based on standard poker hand rankings. We used processing to simulate the game and all the additional visuals + audio. We utilized 7 different classes to create this project. Classes like the Player or Rules class dictate the validity of certain actions, primarily the selection of cards and placing of cards during turns. GameRunner is the main class which drives the game itself - finding the first player, updating turns, displaying the cards, and user functionality. We have a HUD/start menu where the player selects the amount of players (ranges from 2 - 4).  
* Each player starts the game with 13 cards, and the first player is determined as the person with the lowest ranking card.  
* The ranks of card numbers go from 3 -> Ace (lowest to second-highest) with the 2 being the highest.  
* The ranks of suits goes diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades (lowest to highest).
## Instructions
To compile our project, you simply run the game from Processing. The only library you need to have is the Sound library as there is background music and various sounds for aspects of the game.
As for usage, we have keybinds for different aspects of the game.  
*Every player starts off with 13 cards, unsorted. Players press the **'s'** key to sort the cards in proper order.  
*To pass, players press **'p'**.  
*To change the color of the cards during the game, players can press **'1', '2', '3', '4', or '5'** for different coloring options.  
*At the end, there will be a game over screen that tells the player the winner, and also gives the keybind, **'r'**, as an option to restart the game.
